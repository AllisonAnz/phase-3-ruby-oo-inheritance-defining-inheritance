# Why Inheritance 
# In the real world, different entities (people, animals, cars etc) are related in various ways 
# Within a single entity or group, there exist systems of classification 

# Example:
# The dog entity or category includes pugs, corgies labs etc 
# All of these breeds share a commone feature because they are all dogs 
# But they all have ceratin unique traits as well 

# Another Example:
# Writing a web application in which users are either admins, instructors of students 
# ALl these entites are "users" and have commone features 
# but they all have some unique traits as well 

# We can use inheritance 
# it allows us to create a family of classes with shraed behavior, 
# while still defferentiating those classes 

# With inheritance, we could inherit the Admin, Instructor and Student classes 
# from a User class 
# any changes made to the User class would apply to the other class 

# What is Inheritance 
# In Ruby, classes can inherit from one another 
# meaning that they adopt all of the attributes and bejaviors (all of the methods) of the parent 
# also called the super class
